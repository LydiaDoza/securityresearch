# Exploiting HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities

## About these notes

This page contains the notes I took while reading the Portswigger Academy site about [exploiting HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities.](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting)

The images found in these notes are also from Portswigger, so that I may refer back to them quickly 

## Using HTTP req smuggling to bypass front-end security controls

in some apps, the front-end server decides whether to allow individual reqs to be processed. Allowed reqs are then forwarded to back-end server, where the back-end server is presumed to have passed through the front-end security controls.

say the current user is permitted to access /home but not /admin.

 `POST /home HTTP/1.1  
Host: vulnerable-website.com  
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
Content-Length: 62  
Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
  
0  
  
GET /admin HTTP/1.1  
Host: vulnerable-website.com  
Foo: xGET /home HTTP/1.1  
Host: vulnerable-website.com`

the front-end server sees two requests, both for /home, so forwards to the back-end server. However, the back-end server only sees one req for /home and one for /admin because it assumes the reqs have passed through the front-end access controls, so grants the restrictred URL
